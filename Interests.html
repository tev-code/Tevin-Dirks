	<p>As cliche' as it may sound when it comes to interests I do enjoy sports especially the likes of soccer and mixed martial arts. Besides the physical side of life I like to stay up to date with the world of tech ranging from the gaming sector right through to new applications for different needs, I also enjoy the graphic and styling side of web development as I am allowed to express my creativity both in the functionality and appearance of websites/apps. That being said my ideal workplace would have to be along the lines of a fun, constant learning and creative environment where I am able to grow, offer my skill-set and express my skill-set to the best of my ability. </p>
